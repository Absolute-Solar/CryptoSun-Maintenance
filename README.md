```

### Recovery Procedures

```bash
# Restore from snapshot
./scripts/recovery/restore_from_snapshot.sh <SNAPSHOT_PATH>

# Verify ledger integrity after recovery
cargo run --bin ledger-verify
```

## Security Tools

Tools to maintain the security of your CryptoSun infrastructure:

### Monitoring

```bash
# Scan for common security misconfigurations
./scripts/security/configuration_scan.sh

# Monitor for suspicious RPC activity
cargo run --bin rpc-security-monitor
```

### Key Management

```bash
